# Verily Pathfinder Virtual Agent Template for COVID-19 
Verily, in partnership with Google Cloud, has launched a curated Dialogflow 
template for health systems and hospitals, enabling chat or voice bots to 
answer questions about COVID-19 symptoms and provide the latest guidance from 
public health authorities like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
and World Health Organization (WHO). 

It can:
* Automatically answer frequently asked questions about COVID-19 
* Help users understand possible symptoms and severity
* Guide users to relevant information from public health authorities

You can:
* Launch your bot faster with curated content
* Customize to match your website and add content to address your organization 
and community needs  
* Provide up-to-date information about COVID-19 to your community, which is 
updated regularly by Verily 

Information on COVID-19 changes frequently. Check release dates and review 
content before launching your bot.

template (the "Template")](./agent-template/covid-19-agent-template.zip), so you

### Integrate with Twilio to provide the agent over SMS [optional]
You can deploy a Twilio to Dialogflow "bridge" running serverless Cloud Run to expose your agent over SMS. See the [these instructions](./twilio-sms).

#### Requirements
* A GCP Project with existing Dialogflow Agent setup in a project we'll refer 
to as `PROJECTDIALOGFLOW`
* A second GCP project that will host this application using AppEngine we'll 
refer to as `PROJECTAPPENGINE` For the record, this may very well be the same as
`PROJECTDIALOGFLOW`
* You must login to gcloud as a user that has access to both projects.
* Install gcloud SDK
* Install node.js
* Install make

##### Requirements for development
* run `npm install -g @angular/cli`
* set Env variable `PROJECTDIALOGFLOW`
`export PROJECTDIALOGFLOW=[value you set for PROJECTDIALOGFLOW]`

#### Setup
* In `/Makefile` set the environment variables for `PROJECTDIALOGFLOW` and `PROJECTAPPENGINE` 
* Run `make init` 
* To develop, you will need a need a service account and credentials. To do 
this run `make serviceaccount`

##### Explanation
Running `make init` will do the following:
* Enable API access on `PROJECTAPPENGINE`
* Intialize AppEngine on `PROJECTAPPENGINE`
* Enable Cloud Run service account to deploy to AppEngine on `PROJECTAPPENGINE`
* Enable AppEngine on `PROJECTAPPENGINE` service account to call Dialogflow 
on `PROJECTDIALOGFLOW`  
* Create project metadata for App Engine to use so we don't have to hardcode \
project ids. 
* Create service account for Dialogflow   
* Grant service account access to `PROJECTDIALOGFLOW`
* Download key for service account. 
* Install node_modules. 
* Create Angular builder for Cloud Build 

#### To Develop
* Run `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=[replace with the path to this app]/creds/creds.json`
* Run `make dev`

#### To Deploy
* Run `make deploy`

### Interaction with Dialogflow API
You can follow this [quick start](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/quick/api) to interact with your agent using Dialogflow API.
 
### Integrate Your Agent with Text-based Third-Party Conversation Platform
Dialogflow has integrated with various text-based conversation platforms such 
as Facebook, Telegram, Line, Slack, etc. You can follow instructions at 
[Integration Page](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/integrations) to 
set up an integration for each platform.

### Integrate with Dialogflow phone Gateway
Dialogflow provides a one-click integration for a telephone interface to your 
agent by selecting a phone number hosted by Google. See our 
[documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/integrations/phone-gateway) 
for detailed instructions. Please note that if you expect your virtual agent to 
have a high call volume, request a toll-free phone number during the set up.
